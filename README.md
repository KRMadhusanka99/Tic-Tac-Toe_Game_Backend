# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game_Backend

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe REST API. Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where opponents take turns marking an empty cell in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols ("X" or "O"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. This API implementation utilizes Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and AWS for hosting.

## Features

- Player can register using unique name
- Registered players can start game
- Ongoing games can reset 
- Active players can play there turn

## API Endpoints (Postman collection):
- Postman Documentation URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25973908/2s9Ye8eubT

## Run Locally

Start as normal spring boot application. 

## Running Tests

Use Postman to check API Endpoints. All Endpoints' description has mention above.
## Support
If any case the host services not working properly you can download my code from GitHub using the above-mentioned URL, extract and run it as a normal spring boot app. Then for API calling use http://localhost:8080 or the port that your computer has given rather than using the IP address I mentioned above.

Furthermore, I used a hosted database as well, so if any case the database not working as expected, you need to change the application.properties class to your local database configurations. I already commented on code lines for your easiness.
